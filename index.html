  <h1>SIMR Seminars</h1>

  <h3>Seattle's Informal Microbiome Research Seminars</h3>

  SIMR's goal is to provide a constructive & supportive space to offer & receive feedback on our microbiome research, including on work in progress. Seminars aren't recorded (to encourage presentations on new work), and most of the audience is members of the academic/clinical microbiome community in the greater Seattle area and its alumni.

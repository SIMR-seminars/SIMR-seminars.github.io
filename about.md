### Purpose and Scope

The goal of Seattle's Informal Microbiome Research (SIMR) Seminars is to provide a constructive and supportive space to offer & receive feedback on our microbiome research, including on work in progress.

Seminars aren't recorded (to encourage presentations on new work), and most of the audience are members of the academic/clinical microbiome community in the greater Seattle area and its alumni.

### Format

SIMR Seminars are held approximately every other Wednesday between 3:30-4:30pm PST. Check out the upcoming schedule [here](https://simr-seminars.github.io/)!

Typically, we have 2 x 20 minute presentations per session, with 3-5 minutes of questions/discussion after each. Presenters are encouraged to stay beyond 3:30-4:30 for continued discussion, if possible. We recognize that these are quite short talks, but this fits with our theme of being informal and allows us more space for more presenters, and more time for audience questions.

At present, seminars are **virtual** held via Zoom -- please contact us for the zoom link!
